Attribouter is a lightweight "about screen" for Android apps, built to allow developers to easily give credit to a project's contributors and open source libraries, while matching the style of their app and saving the largest amount of time and effort possible.

For demonstration and experimentation, an apk of the sample project can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/TheAndroidMaster/Attribouter/releases/).

## Screenshots

This is just sample data. It is not real. Though Jahir is lazy, so that part is (joking).

## Usage

### Setup

The Gradle dependency is available through jCenter, which is used by default in Android Studio. To add the dependency to your project, copy this line into the dependencies section of your app's build.gradle file.
 
```gradle
compile 'me.jfenn:attribouter:0.0.3'
```

#### Starting an Activity
This is pretty simple.

``` java
Attribouter.from(context).show();
```

#### Creating a Fragment
This is also pretty simple.

``` java
Fragment fragment = Attribouter.from(context).toFragment();
```

### Request Limits

This library does not use an auth key for the GitHub API by default. It does cache data for up to 10 days to avoid crossing GitHub's [rate limits](https://developer.github.com/v3/rate_limit/), but if your project has more than a few contributors and libraries *or* you want it to have access to a private repository, you will need to provide an auth token by calling `.withGitHubToken(token)` on your instance of `Attribouter`.

### Configuration
By default, Attribouter will use the configuration file at [res/xml/attribouter.xml](https://github.com/TheAndroidMaster/Attribouter/blob/master/attribouter/src/main/res/xml/attribouter.xml). You can either name your configuration file "attribouter.xml" to override the resource, or name it differently and call `.withFile(R.xml.[name])` on your instance of `Attribouter` instead.

The configuration file consists of a single root element, `<about>`, with several possible child elements that can be added any amount of times in any order. You can either make one by looking at the [configuration file](https://github.com/TheAndroidMaster/Attribouter/blob/master/app/src/main/res/xml/about.xml) of the sample app for an example, or by using the list below.

#### `<appInfo>`
Displays the app icon, name, version, and links to the project on github and its website if available.

|Attribute|Type|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|
|repo|String (name/repository)|The github repository to fetch data from.|
|icon|String (URL) / Drawable Resource|The app icon to display.|
|description|String / String Resource|A short description of the app/project.|
|playStoreUrl|String / String Resource (URL)|The URL of the app on the Play Store (generated from the package name by default).|
|websiteUrl|String / String Resource (URL)| The website of the project.|
|gitHubUrl|String / String Resource (URL)|The URL for the open source GitHub project. You do not need to define this if it is the same as `repo`.|

##### `<link>`
Link tags can exist inside of the `<appInfo>`, `<contributor>`, or `<project>` tags. A few links are generated by default, such as links to the github profile of contributors for which the `login` attribute has been specified, and so on. App info links are displayed below the app description, contributor links are displayed in a dialog (that only appears if the contributor has a `bio`), and project links are displayed below the project description. See [issue #12](https://github.com/TheAndroidMaster/Attribouter/issues/12) for more information about this tag.

|Attribute|Type|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|
|id|String|The id of the link, to prevent duplicate links from being created.|
|name|String / String Resource|The name/title of the link.|
|url|String|The url of the link.|
|icon|String (URL) / Drawable Resource|The icon to display next to the link.|
|priority|Integer|Defines how the links should be sorted - the highest priority appears first in the list, and/or is opened when the whole item is clicked.|

Auto-generated links for the `<appInfo>` tag are as follows:

|ID|Description|Required Attributes|
|-----|-----|-----|
|github|The github repository of the project.|`repo` or `gitHubUrl`|
|website|The website of the project.|`repo` (if the repo has a website assigned) or `websiteUrl`|
|playStore|A 'rate' button that opens the app in the play store.|`playStoreUrl` or `repo` (if the repository url is the play store url)|

#### `<text>`
A block of text.

|Attribute|Type|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|
|text|String / String Resource (HTML)|A string or string resource, can be formatted in html (links work too) that defines the text to display.|
|centered|Boolean|Whether the text should be centered.|

#### `<contributors>`
Shows a list of the contributors of a project on github, merged with a list of child `<contributor>` elements defined in the configuration file. For example, if a user with the login "TheAndroidMaster" is both in GitHub and the configuration file, its attributes will be merged so that any attributes beginning with a "^" character will override the information from GitHub, and any attributes not beginning with a "^" character will be used while the GitHub information is loading, or if the information from GitHub is not present or unavailable.

|Attribute|Type|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|
|repo|String (name/repository)|The GitHub repository to fetch contributors from.|
|title|String / String Resource|The title to show above the contributors (defaults to @string/title_attribouter_contributors / "Contributors").|
|overflow|Integer (>= -1)|The maximum number of contributors to display in the list. Additional contributors are displayed in a dialog. If the number is 0, the entire list is replaced with a button titled "View %s" ('%s' being the title attribute). If the number is -1, all of the contributors are displayed.|
|showDefaults|Boolean|Whether or not to show the default contributors in this list (me and the contributors to this repository).|

##### `<contributor>`

|Attribute|Type|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|
|login|String|The GitHub username/login of the contributor (especially useful for overriding specific attributes of certain contributors.|

|task|String / String Resource|A short phrase describing the contributor's role in the project ("Icon Designer", "Founder", etc).|
|bio|String / String Resource|The biography of the contributor.|
|blog|String / String Resource (URL)|The contributor's website.|
|email|String / String Resource|The email of the contributor.|
|position|Integer|If this attribute is given to three contributors with values between 1 and 3 (one each), they will be displayed in a row at the top of the list (1 in the middle, slightly bigger, 2 on the left, 3 on the right).|
|hidden|Boolean|Whether to remove the contributor from the list. This is only really useful if you want to remove certain contributors that are fetched from GitHub. Default value is 'false', obviously.

###### `<link>`

### Things You Can Override

Couple strings, drawables, themes, etc. If you make any translations, feel free to make a PR because I like PRs. PRs are nice.
